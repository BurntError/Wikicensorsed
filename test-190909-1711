== prologue ==

jeb bush is sitting in his elliptical office in an overstuffed leather chair going through his cigar collection to see if it needs organizing.  His secretary calls on his intercom and tells him the campaign manager, Marathoni, is in her office in a wild state.  He has her buzz him through and he comes running in all flustered and breathless.

[''Ed- no farmers daughter jokes'']

"mr bush! mr bush!"

== last one for today, I promise ==

banker dies, sees a light at the end of a long, dark tunnel.  He follows it and after a while he comes to two doors.  One says 'heaven' and one says 'hell.'  So what the hell, he figures, Im a banker, and whatnot so he chooses the door to hell.  He gets down to the bottom of the shopping escalator and the fire and brimstone is burning his nose and the plastic fibers in his three piece suit are melting and forming virulent chemical reactions with the yak hair in the tweed its so bad he can hardly breathe or stand up.  Along comes a minor demon about 3-4 feet tall dressed like a doctor who was watching television carrying a clipboard and says 'name?'

The banker tells him his name and the demon puts on his reading glasses and thumbs through the thick sheaf of paper on his clipboard.  After looking for a while he looks up and says 'youre not on the list.  happens sometimes.  Ill tell peter youre on your way up to straighten this out.  use the elevator over there'  

So the guy goes over to the elevator and after a while gets off at the top and theres the gates, peter the clouds and so on.  Hes just getting off the phone.  'Azarus told me what happened.  Ill call records and see whats going on.'  

So he gets back on the phone for a while and pretty soon a door opens and out comes a mid-level management angel from the marketing department.  

'Well?'  Peter asks the newcomer.  

'I looked him up in the system' says the angel.  The banker waits expectantly, wishing he had a highball or a martini or three. 

'And?' elicits peter.  

'I just cant understand it," the angel muses.  "He borrows at 3, he lends at 6.  hes on the golf course at 3'

- 'whats the catch'

'theres a penalty for early withdrawal'

hershel is taking the subway home from mikveh in brooklyn when he overhears his good friend shlomo lecturing his grandaughter in the next cubicle.  "Avi, you need to listen to me very carefully," overhears hershel.  "These people, they are no good.  They say the nicest things, tell you the sweetest stuff to make you think theyre your friend.  Then, next thing you know youre fucked.  Not only that, afterwards they stubbornly persist in refusing to be of any further assistance, instead leaving you to face your troubles they caused all on your own and even begin sabotaging you at every turn in every imagineable way and then some unimagineable ones too."

"Ay, shlomo" interjects hershel from behind the partition.  It is good you are telling Avi of the dangers of teenage dating"

"What dating?" returns shlomo.  "I am talking about the democrats"

[''ed: again, in the most unifying and healing way possible'']

== test ==

Rabbit gets asked to speak at the bear convention on the topic of 'does shit stick to yore butt.'  As the day finally arrives, rabbits flown in on a corporate jet and whisked to the bear convention in a private limousine.  After a meal and some soft music to set the mood, the lights dim and rabbit takes the stage.  Squinting into the glare of the spotlight and casting a shadow against the soft velvety plush curtain backdrop at the podium, rabbit clears his throat rather harshly and begins to speak.

"Is this thing on?" he queries, as the sound system howls and squeals in a tortured manner with feedback.  "Thank you for allowing me to speak at your convention" he continues, after the ursine technicians get everything squared away.  "On the topic of 'does shit stick to my butt,' I would just like to say, you _would_ _not_ _believe_ how aften I am axed this question.'  Loosening his tie and kravatte, so that he may speak a little more comfortably, he continues.  "In response to your concerns, I would just like to say... [[w:poop|POOP]]!"
